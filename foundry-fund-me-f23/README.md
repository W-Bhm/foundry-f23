# FundMe Project from the Cyfrin Updraft Course

## About

This project is part of the Cyfrin Updraft course, which focuses on building a decentralized application (dApp) using Solidity and Foundry.
The project includes a main contract, a test contract, and a mock contract for testing purposes.
The main contract allows users to fund a project and withdraw funds, while the test contract tests the functionality of the main contract.

## Requirements

## Contracts
- FundMe: The main contract that allows users to fund a project and withdraw funds.
- FundMeTest: A test contract that tests the FundMe contract.
- FundMeMock: A mock contract that simulates the behavior of an oracle for testing purposes.
